                During the Hackusama — Hack on Polkadot’s Wild Cousin, our team has studied the UN Agreement Governing
                the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies from 1979. Based on the studied
                material, it was proposed to consider the interplanetary architecture of the Kusama network and create
                software modules that implement article 6 “On freedom of scientific investigation”, article 7 “On
                preventing disruption of the existing balance of its environment” and article 9 “On the establishment of
                manned and unmanned stations”.
                <br />
                During the experiment, the rover traverses the route within the boundaries of the new habitable station.
                Then he publishes odometry and photos to the Kusama network. This information may be enough for SpaceY
                to start designing and selling living spaces on Mars using the adjacent slot for its parachain.
